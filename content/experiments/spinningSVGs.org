#+DESCRIPTION: Making SVGs play in the canvas

Playful experiment attempting to use SVGs within HTML canvas. Using the SVGs directly was too expensive, so I copied them across to a offscreen/ sprite-canvas, and then copied across the needed sprite on the render cycle.

I attempted to keep my files more functional in style, which allowed me to learn some things along the way. The code and it's resulting effects aren't perfect, but good enough for what I was aiming for. Also, my kids loved playing with the imperfections, so I left them in.
