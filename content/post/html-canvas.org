** Oh the joys
   Canvas was positioned to be the Flash replacement. 

*** Brand new second hand
    Even though cavas has been around for a while, I have only recently had the opportunity to build something. The project requirements were:
    - small file size
    - no need for the DOM
    - highly interactive & visually appealing

    The timeline was tight too, which made me reach for canvas. I had been exposed to canvas experiments before and had a good idea of the direction that I wanted the project to go. 
*** SVG girl in a raster world
    One secondary object I had for the project was to use svg images within canvas. I quickly learnt that canvas, like most real-time graphics engines, prefers raster resources.
*** Do the lifting offscreen
*** Batch processing
