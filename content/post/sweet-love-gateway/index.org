Even though I got involved with the AfrikaBurn website build in 2010, Ephemeropolis was my first burn. Attending AfrikaBurn has long been on the todo list, so late last year, we started making plans. Since 2010, my group of friends & I had gotten a lot of experience building projects at Oppikoppi & Meilie-pop. AfrikaBurn is a better setting for art-projects & building things, so building our own project seemed natural since we were going.

** Prototyping
*** Funding
*** Logistics
*** Afrikaburn 2019: Ephemeropolis
