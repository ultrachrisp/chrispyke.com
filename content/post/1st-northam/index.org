#+DESCRIPTION: Good times in the dust

This was another unlikely initiative. I can quite clearly remember the moment that the idea hit me. I was sitting on a low stool, pratically squatting while cutting cherry tomatoes to make pesto pasta before we hit the night shows at Oppikoppi 2009. Everyone who heard the idea laughed, cause it was hilarious, and yet it was that single thought that set things in motion. All the amazing friendships, the laughs, the excuse to go out into the bush one more time to listen the best live music South Africa could provide, all while being badly behaved.
